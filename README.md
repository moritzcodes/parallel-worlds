## 🎬 What It Does

<div align="center">
  <img src="public/main-view.png" alt="Parallel Worlds - Main View" width="800">
  <p><em>Explore a single narrative perspective with interactive navigation</em></p>
</div>

- **🌍 Parallel Narratives** - Experience the same story from multiple perspectives and outcomes
- **🎨 AI-Generated Video** - Leverage AI video generation to create branching narratives
- **🔄 Interactive Exploration** - Navigate between different "worlds" and timelines seamlessly
- **📐 Multi-View Experience** - Compare parallel narratives side-by-side in a grid layout
- **🎯 Narrative Control** - Switch between perspectives like "Catch", "Sky", "Joy", and "Fate"
- **⚡ Real-time Generation** - Watch AI create video variations in real-time

## 📸 Multi-View Preview

<div align="center">
  <img src="public/multiple-view.png" alt="Parallel Worlds - Multiple View" width="800">
  <p><em>Compare parallel narratives simultaneously in a multi-panel view</em></p>
</div>

This app demonstrates how AI video generation fundamentally changes our relationship with media:

- **From Linear to Parallel** - Traditional media follows a single narrative path. AI enables exploring multiple outcomes simultaneously.
- **From Passive to Interactive** - Viewers become explorers, choosing which narrative path to follow.
- **From Fixed to Fluid** - Stories become dynamic, with infinite variations generated on-demand.
- **From Creation to Curation** - The role shifts from creating one perfect story to curating meaningful narrative experiences.

## 🔄 How It Works


1. **🌐 World Creation** - Each "world" represents a different narrative perspective or outcome
2. **🔄 Navigation** - Interactive controls let you switch between parallel narratives
3. **📊 Multi-View** - Compare multiple narratives side-by-side in grid layout
4. **⏱️ Timeline Sync** - Navigate through time across different narrative branches
5. **🎨 Visual Exploration** - Experience how the same story evolves differently in each world

## 🎯 The Paradigm Shift

This project explores how AI video generation enables:

- **Non-linear Storytelling** - Stories that branch and converge, creating unique experiences for each viewer
- **Infinite Variations** - The same narrative seed can generate countless parallel realities
- **Interactive Media** - Viewers actively shape their experience by choosing which paths to explore
- **Collaborative Creation** - AI and human creators work together to build narrative experiences
- **Personalized Narratives** - Each exploration creates a unique story tailored to the viewer's choices
